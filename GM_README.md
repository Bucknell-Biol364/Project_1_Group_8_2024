## Target Audience

Students in BIOL 203/204 with a base level understanding of RStudio.

## Instructions



## Objectives
2. By the end of this tutorial, students should be able to confidently construct different graphs, including but not limited to, scatterplots, bar charts, box and whisker, histograms, QQ plots, etc. Students will have clear interpretations of these graphs and how they represent relationships in the data. 


2.1 Data Visualization: Students will be able to generate visualizations of data using the ggplot function and choose the appropriate graph according to relationships between variables, types of variables in the dataset, and your hypothesis.

2.2 Graphical Analysis: Students will be able to effectively analyze these graphs and have the tools to understand what the visuals mean in terms of their hypothesis and/or question. Students will maintain clarity in explaining what these graphs do, what our objective is in making these graphs, and how this brings us closer to our final goal. 

You will need to edit this README.md document when your tutorial is complete to include instructions for using the tutorial.
