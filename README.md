## Target Audience

This tutorial is designed for students enrolled in BIOL 203/204 who possess a basic understanding of RStudio. It is intended for students who have already installed RStudio and are familiar with the interface, as well as basic coding practices, including writing, annotating, and running code. 

## Instructions

1. By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to understand and confidently apply basic data analysis techniques in RStudio, including statistical tests ranging from summary statistics to ANOVAs, to interpret and analyze data sets.

1.1 Basic Descriptive Statistics: 
Students will be able to calculate basic descriptive statistics including summary statistics, such as sample size, range, mean, median, and standard deviation. 

1.2: Statistical Testing:
Students will be able perform statistical tests including t-tests and ANOVAs, as well as understand the outputs.  



  2. By the end of this tutorial, students should be able to confidently construct different graphs, including but not limited to, scatterplots, bar charts, box and whisker, histograms, QQ plots, etc. Students will have clear interpretations of these graphs and how they represent relationships in the data. 


2.1 Data Visualization: Students will be able to generate visualizations of data using the ggplot function and choose the appropriate graph according to relationships between variables, types of variables in the dataset, and your hypothesis.

2.2 Graphical Analysis: Students will be able to effectively analyze these graphs and have the tools to understand what the visuals mean in terms of their hypothesis and/or question. Students will maintain clarity in explaining what these graphs do, what our objective is in making these graphs, and how this brings us closer to our final goal. 


## Objectives
